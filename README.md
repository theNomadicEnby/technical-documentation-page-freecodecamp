# Technical Documentation Page -- freeCodeCamp

My solution for freeCodeCamp's "Build A Technical Documentation Page" certification project for my Responsive Web Design Certification.

This is the fourth certification project of [freeCodeCamp Legacy Front End Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/build-a-product-landing-page-project/build-a-product-landing-page/).

This project was built with HTML and CSS.

## Objective

- [x] Build an app that is functionally similar to <https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks>.

## User stories
- [x] Your product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`
- [x] You can see an image within the `header` element with a corresponding `id="header-img"` (A logo would make a good image here)
- [x] Within the `#header` element, you can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`
- [x] You can see at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `nav-link`
- [x] When you click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page
- [x] You can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`
- [x] Your landing page has a `form` element with a corresponding `id="form"`
- [x] Within the form, there is an `input` field with `id="email"` where you can enter an email address
- [x] The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for
- [x] The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
- [x] Within the form, there is a submit `input` with a corresponding `id="submit"`
- [x] When you click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: `https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit`)
- [x] The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport
- [x] Your product landing page should have at least one media query
- [x] Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once
